```{r}
babynames %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n), max = max(n),
            min = min(n), total2 = sum(n^2))
```


## Your Turn 1

Copmplete the code below to extract the rows where `name == "Khaleesi"`. Then use `summarise()` and `sum()` and `min()` to find:

1. The total number of children named Khaleesi
2. The first year Khaleesi appeared in the data

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_` before running the code)*

```{r}
babynames %>%  
  filter(name == "Khaleesi")  %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n), first = min(year))
```


```{r}
babynames %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n))
```

## Your Turn 2

Use `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and `arrange()` to display the ten most popular names. Compute popularity as the *total* number of children of a single gender given a name.

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_` before running the code)*

```{r}
babynames %>%
  group_by(name, sex) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(name, desc(total)), y = total, fill = sex)) +
  labs( x = "10 Most Popular Names Since 1880", 
        y = "Total Number Born") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) + #gets rid of the legend
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "lightblue")) #goes by alaphabetical order
```
```{r}
babynames %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*prop,2), nper = round(percent)) #have to do the percent first then nper you can add to it,
```


## Your Turn 3

Fill in the blanks to: 
Rank each name _within its year and sex_. 

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_` before running the code)*

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(prop))) %>% #mutate adds an extra variable where summaries takes them away.
  #filter(rank <= 10) #this is to see the top 10 names by each year and each sex
  group_by(name, sex) %>%  # average name andsex by years
  summarise(avg_rank = mean(rank)) %>% 
  arrange(avg_rank)

```


***

# Take aways

* Make tables of summaries with `summarise()`  
* Make new variables, with `mutate()`  
* Do groupwise operations with `group_by()`

* Connect operations with `%>%`
